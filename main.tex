\textcolor{red}{Q.1 Fano varieties/ 3-folds: if former then discuss dim 1,2 situation(necessary?), if latter just discuss 3-folds examples}
A nonsingular projective variety $X$ is called a \textit{Fano Variety} if the anticanonical divisor $-K_X$ is ample. In this paper/article, we aim to understand/see the classification of Fano 3-folds. \\

	The following definitions and properties are from \textcolor{cyan}{Isko-1}. For any Cartier divisor $D$ on a variety $X$, $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ wll denote the corresponding invertible sheaf, and, in particular, $\mathcal{O}_X(-K_X)$ is the canonical sheaf on $X$ where $-K_X$ is the canonical divisor of $X$. \\
	\textcolor{red}{ Q.2 Complete linear system, $h^i(X)$, Proposition 1.3, build upto Prop 1.6 \& as a consequence genus, and the following para- NS(X) =Pic(X) has no torsion, $\rho=b_2$, fundamental divisor $H$, index. Then Def 1.13 for degree.}\\
